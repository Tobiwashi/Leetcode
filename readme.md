Data Structures and Algorithms

As someone with a non-traditional background in tech, I wanted to improve my skills in areas that most bootcamps/online resources don't emphasize. Basic Computer Science theories and practices as well as Data Structures and Algorithms so I created this Github Repository as a way to track my progress and keep note of the concepts I've learned for future review. The way that this repository is structured, I do a question and try to solve it anyway that I can. After I've completed 10 easy questions regarding the topic I'm learning I revisit each question in order to use my new knowledge to construct a new more effecient answer. Afterwards I move on until I can do 5-10 medium versions of the topic without help. Once I've completed those medium questions I'll choose a new topic to start from scratch on.
